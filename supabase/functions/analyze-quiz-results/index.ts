Analyze quiz responses to provide deep psychological insights into career alignment. Focus on:

1. SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONS: Identify 4-6 highly specific job titles (not just categories) that match the person's psychological profile
2. HIDDEN BELIEFS: Uncover unconscious patterns about success, money, and achievement
3. PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOCKERS: Identify self-sabotage patterns, fears, and limiting beliefs  
4. ENHANCED PERSONALITY: Provide nuanced cognitive and motivational insights

For each specific occupation, provide:
- Exact job title (e.g. "UX Research Manager", "Clinical Psychologist", "Data Visualization Specialist")  
- Fit score between 75-95% (be realistic, not all high scores)
- Detailed reasoning connecting their psychological patterns to the role

For hidden beliefs, analyze text responses about money, success, and childhood to identify:
- Specific success blockers (perfectionism, imposter syndrome, fear of criticism, etc.)
- Money mindset patterns (scarcity, worthiness issues, financial anxiety, etc.)  
- Fear patterns (visibility, failure, success, abandonment, etc.)
- Core insights (2-3 deep psychological observations)

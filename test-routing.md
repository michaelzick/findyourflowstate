# Quiz Routing Test Results

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. **React Router v6 Syntax Issue** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Route was using invalid `/question-:questionNumber` syntax
- **Solution**: Changed to `/question/:questionNumber` (React Router v6 standard)
- **Result**: URLs now work as `/question/1`, `/question/2`, etc.

### 2. **Continue Quiz Navigation** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: "Continue Quiz" button wasn't navigating to the correct question
- **Solution**: `loadSavedProgress()` now navigates to saved question after loading
- **Result**: Continue Quiz button properly routes to `/question/X` where X is the saved question

### 3. **Page Refresh Errors** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Refreshing on quiz questions showed "Page Error" from RouteErrorBoundary
- **Solution**: Added `loadSavedProgressSilent()` and better state initialization
- **Result**: Refreshing on `/question/2` properly loads question 2

### 4. **URL Validation**
- **Confirmed**: Quiz supports questions 1-43 (`/question/1` through `/question/43`)
- **Invalid URLs**: Redirect to homepage (`/`)

## Current Routing Behavior:

### Direct URL Access:
- ✅ `/question-1` - Works (loads first question)
- ✅ `/question-2` - Works (loads second question)
- ✅ `/question-43` - Works (loads last question)
- ✅ `/question-0` - Redirects to `/` (invalid)
- ✅ `/question-44` - Redirects to `/` (invalid)

### Navigation Flow:
1. **Start Quiz**: Homepage → `/question-1`
2. **Next/Previous**: Updates URL correctly (`/question-2`, `/question-3`, etc.)
3. **Reset**: Any question page → `/` (homepage)
4. **Complete**: Last question → `/quiz-results`

### Key Functions:
- `goToQuestion(index, skipNavigation)` - Sets question state, optionally navigates
- `nextQuestion()` - Advances to next question and updates URL
- `previousQuestion()` - Goes to previous question and updates URL
- `resetQuizAndClearStorage()` - Clears data and navigates to homepage

## Test URLs to Verify:
- http://localhost:8081/question/1
- http://localhost:8081/question/2
- http://localhost:8081/question/43
- http://localhost:8081/question/0 (should redirect)
- http://localhost:8081/question/999 (should redirect)

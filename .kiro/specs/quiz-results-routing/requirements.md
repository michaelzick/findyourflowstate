# Quiz Results Routing and Persistence Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements a dedicated route for quiz results with localStorage persistence, allowing users to navigate directly to results and recall previous quiz data. The system provides a seamless user experience for accessing quiz results across browser sessions while maintaining data integrity and user control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dedicated Quiz Results Route

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my quiz results via a dedicated URL (/quiz-results), so that I can bookmark, share, or directly navigate to my results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the quiz THEN the system SHALL navigate to /quiz-results route
2. WHEN a user navigates directly to /quiz-results THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate results page content
3. WHEN the /quiz-results page loads THEN the system SHALL scroll to the top of the page (0,0)
4. WHEN no quiz results exist THEN the system SHALL display loading options instead of empty results

### Requirement 2: Quiz Results Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my quiz results to be saved locally, so that I can access them later even after closing the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz results are generated THEN the system SHALL save them to localStorage
2. WHEN new quiz results are generated THEN the system SHALL overwrite previous results in localStorage
3. WHEN the system checks for saved results THEN it SHALL retrieve them from localStorage if they exist
4. WHEN results are saved THEN they SHALL include all analysis data (basic results and AI analysis)
5. WHEN results are retrieved THEN they SHALL be validated for completeness and integrity

### Requirement 3: Results Page State Management

**User Story:** As a user visiting /quiz-results without active quiz state, I want clear options to either start a new quiz or load my previous results, so that I can choose my preferred action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits /quiz-results without active quiz results THEN the system SHALL clear the current display
2. WHEN no active results exist THEN the system SHALL show two action buttons: "Start New Quiz" and "Load Previous Results"
3. WHEN the buttons are displayed THEN "Start New Quiz" SHALL be positioned on the left
4. WHEN the buttons are displayed THEN "Load Previous Results" SHALL be positioned on the right
5. WHEN the page state is cleared THEN no quiz result content SHALL be visible

### Requirement 4: Load Previous Results Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load my previously saved quiz results, so that I can review my analysis without retaking the quiz.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Load Previous Results" AND results exist in localStorage THEN the system SHALL load and display the saved results
2. WHEN a user clicks "Load Previous Results" AND no results exist in localStorage THEN the system SHALL display a modal dialog
3. WHEN no results exist THEN the modal SHALL inform the user "No previous results found"
4. WHEN the no-results modal is displayed THEN it SHALL have an "OK" button to close the modal
5. WHEN the user clicks "OK" THEN the modal SHALL close and return to the action buttons view

### Requirement 5: Start New Quiz Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start a new quiz from the results page, so that I can retake the assessment with proper confirmation of data clearing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Start New Quiz" THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation modal
2. WHEN the confirmation modal appears THEN it SHALL warn about clearing all current data
3. WHEN the confirmation modal appears THEN it SHALL be the same modal used in the quiz interface reset functionality
4. WHEN the user confirms the reset THEN the system SHALL clear all quiz data and navigate to the homepage
5. WHEN the user cancels the reset THEN the system SHALL close the modal and remain on the results page

### Requirement 6: Navigation and Browser Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless browser navigation with the quiz results, so that I can use browser back/forward buttons and bookmarks naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a quiz THEN the browser URL SHALL change to /quiz-results
2. WHEN a user uses the browser back button from /quiz-results THEN they SHALL navigate to the previous page
3. WHEN a user bookmarks /quiz-results THEN they SHALL be able to return to the results page later
4. WHEN a user refreshes /quiz-results THEN the page SHALL maintain its current state (loaded results or action buttons)
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the scroll position SHALL reset to top of page

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable data handling for my quiz results, so that my analysis is always accurate and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN results are saved to localStorage THEN they SHALL include a timestamp and version identifier
2. WHEN results are loaded from localStorage THEN they SHALL be validated for data completeness
3. WHEN localStorage data is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL treat it as no results available
4. WHEN localStorage operations fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors without crashing
5. WHEN results are displayed THEN they SHALL match the original analysis exactly
